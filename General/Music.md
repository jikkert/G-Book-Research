# Music
To play music on the sd-card you go to the SD-Audio choice in the menu.

To add more music to your SD-card you should insert your card into the computer and enable show hidden files. After this you can see a folder called SD Audio where you can install ACC format music (according to [this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20160803003508/g-book.com/pc/whats_G-BOOK/for-auto/default.asp)).

# Install music
From what I learned with using the G-book is that the "secure writing" is quite important for using the system with music.
There are some items you need to perform these steps and make it actually work, since putting mp3 files in the system directly gave me no success.

## Prerequisites
- Have an sd-card reader that supports secure writing according to the Panasonic system.
- The operating system you use should support exFAT formatting I recommend using windows XP.
- An sd card that can be readable by G-book (i used 2gb) due to it not being SDHC.
- Sd-Jukebox should be installed. I tried 2.4 and 5, they both seem to work.
- Install the right drivers (refer to the internet archive sd-jukebox 2.4 version) or be lucky and it will work in one go.
- The sd-card reader should not be connected to an "usb-hub" 

## Install music to the system
1. Download your favourite music onto your operating system in .mp3 format.
2. (Optional) If you have a fresh sd-card i reccommend flashing it first by using sd-jukebox.
