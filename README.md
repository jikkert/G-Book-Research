# G-Book-Research
This repo is made to collect as much as possible about the first G-Book version that is implemented in different cars

## Introduction
Hi, I just bought a Cypha and the G-Book really interested me since it's almost like I'm driving a 2002 tesla with all the features it has. To further inform people about it I made this repo. In here you can also find some specific tips on installing old medium for Windows XP executables and other fun info about the car

## Note
I gathered all the executables from the internet archive and I will only use it
for locality and ease of use. Wherever you want to download a file the original
page is linked. This means you do not need to download it from here if you do
not trust it.

## General Requests
This library is as active as I can be with a full time job. So please if there is information you found that is not in here, contact me or add the info later.

There are some things I am personally really curious about and I do not have information about. So if you have it again please contact me.

Most Wanted:
- A karaoke file. I'm searching for a karaoke file so I can see how to remake these and what format the Will Cypha supports
- Any translated files, due to my lack of Japanese language and translate being quite slow. Translated files will really boost my productivity in this library.
- Games. Some SD cards have bought games on them and I would like to have the whole collection to really see what the capability is of the Cypha. So If you have some please share them to the community.

## Updates
### MUSIC WORKS!!!
I figured out how to upload music to the G-Book system using a virtual machine, mp3 files and sd-jukebox. This is quite a hassle still and I tried 5 different internal/external sd card readers, where only the official 20 year old one worked. But I officially do have music on my own system now.
### Karaoke and Movies
I realised the karaoke system and the video is quite a thing to tackle still. I found a better sd-card reader and I hope to make more progress asap.
Therefore these items are quite delayed. To make an example how long it is taking is that they use custom files for the karaoke system and there are write protections on the one file I do have for karaoke. Furthermore I disected the karaoke file that I have and figured out the audio file. This is in midi format and therefore quite easy to rip and possibly overwrite. Currently I have no success with playing music on the karaoke software with new files but the ripped bytecode of the file does work on VLC when I put it in a new file. Therefore im just stuck now on finding out how the text part of the karaoke since this has a weirder file format. I wil later create a folder with my whole research process.
